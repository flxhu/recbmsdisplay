# TTGO T-Display based screen for REC-BMS
This is a physical display that shows pack voltage, 
state of charge, state of Hhalth, and min and max cell voltage
for an older [REC-BMS balancer](https://www.rec-bms.com/battery-management-system/).

It also connects to a WLAN and exports a web server with the same information.

It's based on a [TTGO T-Display](https://www.lilygo.cc/en-pl/products/lilygo%C2%AE-ttgo-t-display-1-14-inch-lcd-esp32-control-board)
running [CircuitPython 9.x.x](https://circuitpython.org/board/lilygo_ttgo_tdisplay_esp32_16m/).
